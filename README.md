I wanted a programmable stove that could be used for multiple functions.  Most rice cookers are designed for white rice and brown rice requires a little bit longer cooking, so I wanted a stove that could have a special brown rice cooking function.  I also boil water multiple times a day, but I didn't want electric kettle just for that one function.  So I create a programmable induction stove using a simple one burner IH stove and an ESP32 controller.
